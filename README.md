# Introduction to JavaScript: Fundamentals and Features  

## Overview  
This repository contains work for **Module 4** of the *"HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for Web Developers"* course on Coursera by Johns Hopkins University. The focus of this module was to learn the **fundamentals of the JavaScript language**, emphasizing not only *how* it works but also *why* it works, to help developers harness its full potential.  

## Key Concepts Covered  
- JavaScript basics: language constructs and types  
- Objects, functions, and arrays  
- Closures and scope isolation  
- Handling default values  
- Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs)  

## Project Description  
This project includes:  
- Basic HTML structure (index.html)  
- JavaScript files demonstrating key concepts from the module:  
  - **SpeakHello.js**: JavaScript functionality for 'Hello' messages  
  - **SpeakGoodBye.js**: JavaScript functionality for 'Goodbye' messages  
  - **script.js**: Core logic tying the module concepts together  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **JavaScript (ES5)**: Core scripting language for functionality  
- **HTML5**: Basic web page structure  

## How to Run  
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.  
3. Review the JavaScript interactions implemented in the console or browser.  

## Future Improvements  
- Add interactivity or UI components to showcase JavaScript dynamically.  
- Expand functionality with modern JavaScript (ES6+).
